					<h2>Michael J Oria | <strong>Technical Creative</strong></h2>
						<p>I always loved computers. The first time I used one was when I was in the second grade <em>(An Apple II)</em> when I was around 8 years old, and I became hooked in a second. With only a 1 MB of memory, I happened to grow fondly of how you could use a computer to do what you wanted it to do. That thing was pure magic. I mostly made graphics on it but I fell in love with the whole environment. I learned about how a PC worked, turned all the knobs and switches in the programs and became the guy others came to for tech-advice.</p>
